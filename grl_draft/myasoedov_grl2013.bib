abstract = {A method is proposed to retrieve and interpret fine spatial variations of the sea surface roughness in sun glitter imagery. Observed sun glitter brightness anomalies are converted using a transfer function determined from the smoothed shape of sun glitter brightness. The method is applied to MODIS and MERIS sun glitter imagery of natural oil seeps and the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The short-scale roughness variations in the presence of mineral oils slicks are consistently extracted and compared to variations associated with the biogenic slicks. In doing so, the wind speed dependency on the roughness anomalies is also considered. A comparison to normalized radar cross section (NRCS) anomalies taken from the corresponding high resolution ASAR images is performed, and similarities as well as differences are investigated. The results document significant benefit from the synergetic use of sun glitter and radar imagery for detection and monitoring of surface slicks.},

abstract = {A synergetic approach for quantitative analysis of high-resolution ocean synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and imaging spectrometer data, including the infrared (IR) channels, is suggested. This approach first clearly demonstrates that sea surface roughness anomalies derived from Sun glitter imagery compare very well to SAR roughness anomalies. As further revealed using these fine-resolution (1 km) observations, the derived roughness anomaly fields are spatially correlated with sharp gradients of the sea surface temperature (SST) field. To quantitatively interpret SAR and optical (in visible and IR ranges) images, equations are derived to relate the surface roughness signatures to the upper ocean flow characteristics. As developed, a direct link between surface observations and divergence of the sea surface current field is anticipated. From these satellite observations, intense cross-frontal dynamics and vertical motions are then found to occur near sharp horizontal gradients of the SST field. As a plausible mechanism, it is suggested that interactions of the wind-driven upper layer with the quasi-geostrophic current field (via Ekman advective and mixing mechanisms) result in the generation of secondary ageostrophic circulation, producing convergence and divergence of the surface currents. The proposed synergetic approach combining SST, Sun glitter brightness, and radar backscatter anomalies, possibly augmented by other satellite data (e.g., altimetry, scatterometry, ocean color), can thus provide consistent and quantitative determination of the location and intensity of the surface current convergence/divergence (upwelling/downwelling). This, in turn, establishes an important step toward advances in the quantitative interpretation of the upper ocean dynamics from their two-dimensional satellite surface expressions.},

The transfer function, relating the brightness contrast to the MSS contrasts, is found from observed sunglint brightness, where “real” PDF of the sea slopes has built-in. Developed approach was applied for analysis of the sunglint signature of the mesoscale ocean dynamics and internal waves. We found that the ocean currents (eddies, meanders, frontal lines) and internal waves are well visible on the sea surface as the MSS anomalies.

@article{Augustinus2004,
abstract = {The coastal development of the Guianas is dominated by extensive, shoreface-attached and alongshore westward migrating mudbanks. The behaviour of these mudbanks is mainly determined by a combination of the large supply of Amazon-borne silt and clay and the trade wind generated wave action. In the front zone of the mudbanks, fluid mud is formed. As a result, the incoming waves are strongly attenuated and deposition is favoured. At their rear side, compacted clay deposits are eroded by waves. The mudbanks, migrating in this manner, are the driving mechanism in the development of the smallest coastal unit, which consists of a mudbank and the eastward adjacent interbank area. Eisma et al. Neth. J. Sea Res. 28 (1991) 181 has demonstrated that the frequency of the northeast trade wind, which blows towards the coast of the Guianas, in the windy season (January till April), shows a systematic change in time. For the period 19531986, there is evidence that the frequency of winds coming from directions between 50 and 80 (roughly eastnortheast) increases. The same applies to the wind velocity from that direction. In the last 10 years a reversal of these trends appears to occur. For a more or less eastwest directed coastal section, e.g. the coastline of Suriname, a more easterly direction of the northeast trade wind results in an increased longshore wave energy flux in the coastal waters. This causes an increase in length of the mudbanks, at the detriment of the usually eroding interbank parts of the coast. This is evidenced by the large-scale coastal development during the related period, demonstrating an increasing length of the mudbanks and consequently an increasing net accretion. It is hypothesised that this development will reverse if the new trends in wind direction and velocity develop further. At the geological scale, it is considered that a coincidence of a systematic increase of more northerly directed wind frequencies and a fall in sea level are responsible for the two erosive interruptions in the generally accreting coastal plain during the Young Holocene Period.},

abstract = {The existence in the ocean of deep western boundary currents, which connect the high-latitude regions where deep water is formed with upwelling regions as part of the global ocean circulation, was postulated more than 40 years ago. These ocean currents have been found adjacent to the continental slopes of all ocean basins, and have core depths between 1,500 and 4,000 m. In the Atlantic Ocean, the deep western boundary current is estimated to carry (10-40) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) of water, transporting North Atlantic Deep Water-from the overflow regions between Greenland and Scotland and from the Labrador Sea-into the South Atlantic and the Antarctic circumpolar current. Here we present direct velocity and water mass observations obtained in the period 2000 to 2003, as well as results from a numerical ocean circulation model, showing that the Atlantic deep western boundary current breaks up at 8 degrees S. Southward of this latitude, the transport of North Atlantic Deep Water into the South Atlantic Ocean is accomplished by migrating eddies, rather than by a continuous flow. Our model simulation indicates that the deep western boundary current breaks up into eddies at the present intensity of meridional overturning circulation. For weaker overturning, continuation as a stable, laminar boundary flow seems possible.},

abstract = {The Amazon shelf is subject to energetic forcing from a number of different sources, including near-resonant semi-diurnal tides, large buoyancy flux from the Amazon River discharge, wind stress from the northeasterly tradewinds and strong along-shelf flow associated with the North Brazil Current. Although the large volume of river discharge produces a pronounced salinity anomaly, the water motions on the shelf are dominated by the other forcing factors. Tidal velocities of up to 200 cm s−1 are generally oriented in the cross-shelf direction. Tide-induced mixing influences the position and structure of the bottom salinity front that separates the well-mixed nearshore region from the stratified plume. High concentrations of suspended sediment trapped along the frontal zone increase the stability of the tidal boundary layer and thus reduce the bottom stress. At subtidal frequencies, motion is primarily along-shelf toward the northwest, both in the plume and in the ambient, high-salinity water of the outer-shelf. The plume is generally 5–10 m thick, with a salinity of 20–30 psu. The along-shelf velocity within the plume varies as a function of the along-shelf wind stress. This variability results in large temporal variations in plume structure and freshwater content on the shelf. The net northwestward motion of the Amazon plume and of the ambient shelf water appears to be the result of a large-scale pressure gradient associated with the North Brazil Current system.},

The prediction quality was estimated by analyzing a few waves with very large height observed during the experiment. The empirical formulas have been theoretically interpreted within the framework of the Poisson statistics. It allowed one to predict internal waves for various water regions.},

abstract = {A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the suns glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular slope required for the reflection of the suns rays toward the observer; and (2) of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited by the disappearance of the glitter into a background consisting of (1) the sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight reflected by the sea surface.The method has been applied to aerial photographs taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photographs, and cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec-1. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tan 16)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-1. The ratio of the up/downwind to the crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peakedness which is barely above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peakedness unchanged.},
